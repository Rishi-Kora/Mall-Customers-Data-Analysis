# Mall-Customers-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer behavior and perform customer segmentation using the "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset within a Google Colab environment.<br>

1. Import Necessary Libraries:<br>

Begin by importing essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, including pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn components.<br>

2. Load the Dataset:<br>

Load the "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset from Google Drive into a pandas DataFrame. This dataset likely contains information about customer demographics, spending habits, and other relevant features.<br>

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:<br>

4. Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately. This ensures data quality and avoids errors during analysis.<br>

5. Dropping Irrelevant Columns: Remove columns that are not relevant to the analysis, such as customer IDs or other identifiers. This simplifies the dataset and focuses on the important features.<br>

6. Duplicate Removal: Identify and remove any duplicate rows in the dataset to prevent biases and ensure accurate results.<br>

7. Outlier Detection and Removal: Detect and handle outliers, which are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data.
This step is crucial for preventing outliers from skewing the analysis. The Z-score method can be used to identify outliers based on standard deviations from the mean.<br>

8. Data Visualization and Exploration:

Correlation Heatmap: Create a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between numerical features. This helps identify patterns and dependencies between variables.<br>

Descriptive Statistics: Generate descriptive statistics to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.<br>

Boxplots: Use boxplots to visually explore the distribution of features and identify potential outliers.<br>

Pairplots: Utilize pairplots to create scatterplots for all feature combinations, further aiding in understanding feature relationships and potential correlations.<br>

9. Customer Segmentation:

KMeans Clustering: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on relevant features such as annual income and spending score. This unsupervised learning technique aims to group customers with similar characteristics together.<br>

Visualization: Visualize the clusters using a scatterplot to understand the segmentation results and identify distinct customer groups.<br>

10. Predictive Modeling:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Train a KNN classifier to predict customer gender based on various features. This supervised learning algorithm uses proximity to classify new data points.<br>

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the KNN model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, classification reports and confusion matrices. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly predict customer genders.<br>
